# atcoder-python

Here is where I store my Pythonic code for solving problems from AtCoder instead of directly submitting my solutions. The reason is because sites like AtCoder, Codeforces and the likes do not support external libraries and hence are unexpectedly unfriendly for real development. In my code, I want to use libraries such as NetworkX and NumPy as much as possible and hence the workflow is to download testcases from AtCoder and execute my code locally, which is a bit more work, but definitely working and better for real programming.

Well, I am not sure how much efforts will be put into this, but for now, and unfortunately now of all time, I find it much interesting than competing on Codeforces. (any programming languages I like, any libraries at my convenience and really healthy for my practical skills)

Thanks AtCoder for publishing your testcases unlike the stingy Codeforces and Kattis.

Happy Coding!
